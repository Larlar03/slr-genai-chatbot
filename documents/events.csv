Myths express and reflect on fragments of cultural, socio-political, ecological and internal states of being. Whether it be stories to explain the changing of the seasons, the growth of crops and floods or epic tales of adventure, love, jealousy and betrayal, myths have helped us to understand the needs of societies as well as individuals by expressing their innermost turmoil, passions and desires.¬†¬†"

Over the past few years, Matthew‚Äôs way of painting and drawing has noticeably changed. His earlier works were often executed quickly and recklessly, taking cues from whatever was around him at the given moment. He also tended to change a work completely ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì with one spontaneous gesture just when it seemed to be finished. Recent works are far more considered, build up over the course of weeks or months. They appear to be the result of introspection and of a continuous correspondence of feeling and image. During the process, they achieve more and more lightness, while keeping traces of tenderness, cruelty, exertion and exuberance in balance."

Varga Weisz‚Äôs new sculptures represent the first time she has worked with glass, signalling a significant new stage in her sustained exploration of sculpture as a medium and traditional modes of craftsmanship. Developed over the past year, the body of work emerged from Varga Weisz‚Äôs experience of glass during a visit to Murano, following which she began a collaboration with glassmakers in South Tirol to explore the unique potential to express the transitory elements of light and colour inherent to the medium. Reconceived in glass, the sculptural figures draw new parallels with the transparent quality of her watercolour drawings, in which light and colour become transformational elements that animate her characters with formal and metamorphic fluidity."

The exhibition‚Äôs title is taken from a poem written by the artist in the summer of 2022. In the poem, a monk becomes enveloped by a swarm of flies and eaten alive while working on an illuminated manuscript - an analogy for the isolation and slow, detailed study required to make such documents. Over the course of a year, Dunn‚Äôs practice shifted from the large paintings which characterised¬†The Tabernacle, to small, detailed pieces. Dunn made this decision to change her working method consciously, forcing herself to move away from grand gestural pieces and work in a focussed manner at her studio desk. During this period Dunn chose the theory of ‚Äòhorror vacui‚Äô - the notion that each page should be entirely filled, with no white space left visible - as the starting point for the new material. What resulted was a series of six dense compositions in which multiple artistic identities co-exist on a single surface. The gallery space is transformed by paintings recalling the trompe l‚Äôoeil of Renaissance architecture, with specific devotion to San Marco in Florence and the frescoes of Fra Angelico, whose similar intense dedication saw him saying a prayer each time he lifted the paintbrush."

The graduated and shifting colour patterns resulting from this processual experimentation are laid out across cast tablets and analogue photograms.¬†While Fraser‚Äôs geometrical slabs seek to evoke notions of the sublime traditionally pursued in painting, to shift the specific beauty of one medium across to another, Mudde‚Äôs images consist of visualisations of the information embedded in the colours themselves, highlighting the ways in which perception is formed.

Solo Yolo, the first UK solo exhibition of Essen-based artist Niklas Taleb, explores material relations and emotional transitions of everyday ‚Äì being (or having a) solo, coming-of-age, settling down, individuating, communing and assimilating, considered through and as photographic forms & formulas. The half-melancholic, half-facetious twist on the exuberant millennial You Only Live Once mindset of the early social media era (#yolo), a lived mantra of trust fund babies, and a generational coping strategy of those priced out of the previous one‚Äôs stability, Solo Yolo suggests reality hitting home as the dust of the pandemic years settles.¬†"

With a love for raw and improvised art forms, Meera aims for the painting equivalent of a jazz jam, prioritising the energy and authenticity of free mark-making over achieving a polished composition or choreographed act. This exhibition is a celebration of, and warm invitation to consider the vulnerability and empowerment contained in the act of painting without a defined outcome in mind, with all the imperfections, uncertainty and challenges of remaining open to dissonance as well as harmony. Since entering the perimenopausal years, Meera has developed a deeper appreciation of the therapeutic value of painting in this way as an unplanned release of unpredictable, constantly shifting thoughts and emotions. Recent works convey this spirit of restlessness-¬† of moods, ideas and ways of being in flux- unfinished, subject to change."

The gardens, which include a series of bright buildings painted with a special hue of cobalt known as Majorelle Blue, first opened to the public in 1947. Following this, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent purchased the (now overgrown) gardens in 1980 and restored them over the course of several years, making the villa his primary retreat until his death in 2002. The Jardin Majorelle was a source of profound inspiration to Saint Laurent and the gardens are still considered among the most beautiful in the world."

In a break from the traditionallysimplified palette of colours common to early cubism, in some paintings,Hembrow embellishes the figure and surrounding space with patterns of strongprimary colours suggesting the vibrant and intense colour of stained-glasspanels.

Osvaldo Licini (1894-1958) produced some of the most distinctive and idiosyncratic imagery in the history of twentieth-century Italian art. His early years were spent in Bologna, where he met Giorgio Morandi and experienced a fleeting interest in Futurism. Between 1917 and 1926 he divided his time between Italy and Paris, moving in the avant-garde circles of artists such as Modigliani and Picasso. On returning to Italy in the mid-1920s he established himself as a figurative painter of portraits and landscapes. However, early the following decade he abruptly changed direction and adopted a geometric-abstract vocabulary, developing a style infused with a sense of playfulness and poetry recalling that of Paul Klee. Together with artists such as Lucio Fontana and Fausto Melotti, Licini showed work at Milan‚Äôs important Il Milione gallery, and was associated with the international Abstraction Cr√©ation group."

But what these characters and their short missives tell us either candidly or mischievously is about our particular place in the world. As they adapt to the contemporary environment, they subtly jeer at the absurdity of our time through poeticized quotidian scenes."

In 1983, photographer Baldwin Lee left his home in Knoxville, Tennessee, and set off on a road trip through the American South. He did not know what his subject would be. ‚ÄúI had no agenda, no plan,‚Äù he told The New Yorker. ‚ÄúI photographed everything: landscapes, architecture, close-ups, still lifes, night pictures, people, old, young, white, black, poor, rich. I just wanted to see.‚Äù During the trip he found himself drawn to photographing Black Americans at home, at work and at play, in the street and amid nature. Over the next seven years, he made numerous road trips to the South to continue his work. He returned with images so poignant and piercing, the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired his photographs."
